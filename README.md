# Nutri-care Figma Prototypes
This is an assignment for my Human Computer Interaction class where I created three interactive prototypes of an app designed for cancer survivors (a term that refers to
cancer patients at any point post-diagnosis; they may be in active treatment or in remission). The second prototype was a revision of the first one based on a persona of a cancer survivor, while the last one is the finalized version implementing all the knowledge we gained about the struggles cancer survivors face using technology.

My app, Nutri-Care, is designed to support cancer patients by providing healthy recipes tailored to their specific dietary needs. Users can filter recipes based on the symptoms they are experiencing (e.g., fatigue, diarrhea), dietary restrictions (e.g., bland diet, low-calorie diet, neutropenic diet), and meal type (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner). The main thing I considered in the design was simplicity and ease of use to accommodate users who may be experiencing fatigue or cognitive overload, as these are some of the most common symptoms cancer patients experience. To achieve this, I went for a minimalist black-and-white color scheme to ensure a calming effect. 
Navigation was another key consideration. The home, search, favorites, and history buttons are consistently placed at the bottom of the screen on each page, aligning with users’ mental models and making it easy to switch between sections. Additionally, clear labels and explanations for each function ensure that users can interact with the app without confusion. Recognizing that each patient has unique nutritional needs, I included a settings page where users can specify their dietary goals, preferred diet type, and food restrictions. This personalization ensures that the most relevant recipes appear first in search results, reducing the effort required to find suitable meals.

I chose the persona of Mei Lin because my app would be especially helpful to her since she enjoys cooking. Mei experiences cognitive impairments like "chemo brain," mental fatigue, and difficulty concentrating, as well as blurry vision and ongoing fatigue. 
To make the app more accessible and user-friendly for her, I made several key design changes. First, I increased the default text size throughout the app and added a setting that allows users to further adjust the font size to their comfort. I also replaced the decorative font used in the app’s name with a more legible and accessible typeface—Roboto—and made much of the text bold to improve readability.
On the welcome page, I included a short (2-minute) introductory video that explains the role of diet in cancer recovery and highlights the app’s key features. To support Mei’s concentration challenges, I also provided the video’s transcript directly below so she can read along or reference it at her own pace. This avoids overwhelming her with long blocks of text while still ensuring she gets the necessary information.
In the settings page, I added dropdown menus for selecting a diet type and specifying dietary restrictions, making it easier for Mei to personalize her experience. I also created a detailed recipe page featuring oven-baked fajitas, a dish chosen specifically because it supports energy levels and can help combat her fatigue.

Most of the changes I made in this final iteration were based on insights I got from the chemo-brain game. A lot of the personas mentioned struggling with focus and long instructions, so I simplified the welcome page by using bullet points and cutting out any unnecessary info or technical language. I also bolded the key points to make things easier to scan. At the bottom of the welcome page, I added a quick explanation of the symbols used to navigate the app—like pointing out that the hamburger menu on the home page opens the settings—since those things might not be immediately clear. I also clarified that users can customize which recipes get recommended to them on the search page by selecting a diet type or dietary restrictions in the settings.
